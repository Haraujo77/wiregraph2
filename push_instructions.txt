GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter "wiregraph2" as the repository name
   - Add the description: "A 3D card stack visualization tool built with p5.js"
   - Make it Public
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Copy the remote URL from GitHub (it will look like: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wiregraph2.git)

3. Use the following commands in your terminal:
   
   # Remove the existing remote if necessary
   git remote remove origin
   
   # Add your GitHub repository as the remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/haraujo77/wiregraph2.git
   
   # Push your code to GitHub
   git push -u origin main

4. To set up GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - For "Source", select "main" branch 
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build your site

Your site will be available at: https://haraujo77.github.io/wiregraph2/
